# Pulumi Action Roadmap

The potential roadmap for this action is the following:

* Migrate to a TypeScript Actions
  * Potentially based on top of the Pulumi NodeJS Automation API
* Remove Google specific logic
  * This will be replaced by the suggestion to use the Google Actions for this
* Take advantage of the action-install-pulumi-cli for ensuring the correct version of Pulumi is available to use
* Remove NPM / Pypi specific logic to be replaced with appropriate (managed) actions in the workflow

This will form the roadmap for a v2 of the action which we expect to happen early 2021!
